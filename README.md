# Image_Processing-Truncated-Huffman-Code-Compression (Worked on it alone)
Compression using Huffman Code on a gray scale image (Image Processing)
Implement a function that applies the truncated Huffman coding compression to a gray-scale
image. Your function should take the gray-scale image, K and J values as input and outputs
the dictionary and the output code for the input image. Example: Consider an image in which
the gray-levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 are encoded with the codes 0, 10, 110 and 111 respectively. If
the first 5 pixels in the image are 1 1 2 3 4, the expected output code is the following binary
string 0010110111. Apply your function to the image “cameraman.tif”.
